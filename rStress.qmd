# Loss

rStress with $r>0$ is defined as
$$
\sigma_r(x):=\sum_k w_k(\delta_k^r-d_k^r(x))^2
$$

#  First-order Taylor approximation to powered distances

$$
d_k^r(x)\approx d_k^r(y)+rd_k^{r-1}(y)(d_k(x)-d_k(y))
$$
Note that if $r=1$ both sides are equal to $d_k(x)$. If $r=2$
$$
d_k^2(x)\approx d_k^2(y)+2d_k(y)(d_k(x)-d_k(y))=2d_k(x)d_k(y)-d_k^2(y).
$$

# Gauss-Newton approximation to rStress

\begin{align}
\sigma_r(x)\approx&\sum_k w_k(\delta_k^r-d_k^r(y)-rd_k^{r-1}(y)(d_k(x)-d_k(y)))^2=\\
&\sum_k w_k\{rd_k^{r-1}(y)\}^2(\frac{\delta_k^r-d_k^r(y)}{rd_k^{r-1}(y)}-(d_k(x)-d_k(y)))^2
\end{align}
Let
$$
\tilde w_k(y):=r^2w_kd_k^{2(r-1)}(y)
$$
and
$$
\tilde\delta_k(y):=\frac{\delta_k^r-d_k^r(y)}{rd_k^{r-1}(y)}+d_k(y)=\frac{\delta_k^r+(r-1)d_k^r(y)}{rd_k^{r-1}(y)}
$$
then
$$
\sigma_r(x;y)\approx\sum_k\tilde w_k(y)(\tilde\delta_k(y)-d_k(x))^2
$$
which can be minimized by majorization. Also if $x=y$ then $\sigma_r(x;x)=\sigma_r(x)$.

For $r\geq 1$ we have $\delta_k(y)\geq 0$. 

For $r=1$ we have $\tilde w_k(y)=w_k$ and $\tilde\delta_k(y)=\delta_k$. This is
regular smacof.

For $r=2$ we have $\tilde w_k(y)=4w_kd_k^2(y)$ and $\tilde\delta_k(y)=\frac{\delta_k^2+d_k^2(y)}{2d_k(y)}$.

# Algorithm

$$
\sigma_r(x^+)\approx\sigma_r(x^+;x)\leq\sigma_r(x;x)=\sigma_r(x)
$$
